3 main code files

1) Colloc vs CMM:
	Code to find residuals of EVs in Collocation method, using CMM.

2) Find CMM EVs near Colloc EVs:
	Code to find EVs using CMM and Gradient optimization, in locations near to Colloc EVs.

3) Grid_OrrSom_C:
	Code for scanning 2d space of real and imag values of c and plotting a 3D graph of residuals.
